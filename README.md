### JavaScript

- Remove all adverts from the page (right-hand side of the website)
- Change the genre of the film from "comedy" to "drama".
- Change the background of the movie poster to "bg.jpg". It's in the img folder.
  It should be JS only.
- I want to generate a list of films on the page based on the data contained in
  JS file. Sort them alphabetically
- Add numbering of the output movies
- Implement functionality that after filling in the form and pressing the
  "Confirm" button - the new movie is added to the list. The page should not
  reload.The new movie should be added to movieDB.movies.
- If movie name is more than 21 characters - trim it and add three dots
- If you click on trash - the item will be removed from the list (difficult)

  "Add a favorite movie".
- Films should be sorted alphabetically
